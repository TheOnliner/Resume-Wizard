    <h1>What is a resume?</h1><br>
    <p>
        A resume is a one- to two-page document that formalizes and summarizes your work experience, skills and education. When you submit a resume for a job application, you’re showing employers what you’re capable of doing and the abilities you possess that allow you to fulfill the job responsibilities.

Whether you’re attaching a resume to an email or filling out a job application that asks you to submit a resume online, having a complete professional resume is crucial.
